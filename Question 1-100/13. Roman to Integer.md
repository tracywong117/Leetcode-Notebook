## 13. Roman to Integer

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "IV"
Output: 4
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "IX"
Output: 9
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 15`
- `s` contains only the characters `('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M')`.
- It is **guaranteed** that `s` is a valid roman numeral in the range `[1, 3999]`.



#### Python 

`if i>0 and d[s[i]]>d[s[i-1]]:` 

> if i==0, it will not go to `d[s[i]]>d[s[i-1]]`, therefor no out of index

```python
class Solution(object):
    def romanToInt(self, s):
        d={'I':1,'V':5,'X':10,'L':50,'C':100,'D':500,'M':1000}
        ans=0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if i>0 and d[s[i]]>d[s[i-1]]:
                ans-=d[s[i-1]]*2
                ans+=d[s[i]]
            else:
                ans+=d[s[i]]
                
        return ans
```



```python
class Solution(object):
    def romanToInt(self, s):
        special={'IV':4,'IX':9,'XL':40,'XC':90,'CD':400,'CM':900}
        d={'I':1,'V':5,'X':10,'L':50,'C':100,'D':500,'M':1000}
        ans=0
        for key,value in special.items():
            ans+=s.count(key)*value
            s=s.replace(key,"")
        for key,value in d.items():
            ans+=s.count(key)*value
            s=s.replace(key,"")
        return ans
```
